        Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design and
        development! In this exercise, we'll play around with some of the common
        CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a nice blog
        post-like web page.

      <h2>All About Typography</h2>
      <p class="headline">
        Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the reader's
        attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important information
        in a web page. You can use <code>text-transform: uppercase;</code> to
        make a whole body of text uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab
        attention!
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which
        you should do sparingly) - it's time to chat more about other components
        of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font for our
        headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is
        intentional! Serif font faces are generally considered pretty
        inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more
        difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one another. At
        large font sizes, such as those seen in most headings, serif fonts are
        considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where
        serif characters start and where they end.
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page?
        Another common thing you might see in web pages are quotes. To make
        quotes, we can use the <code>blockquote</code> element and style it
        accordingly, so it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        "This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it
        some nice styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience
        Design, where we take special care to implement our web page in a way
        that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers.
        Differentiating our different typography components visually makes
        information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."

      <h3>a new section</h3>
      <p>
        And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a
        <code>hr</code>
        element (a 'horizontal rule' or a divider) and a new heading. Isn't
        putting content together fun?
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice as well that when we entered in the <code>H3</code> content, it
        was all lowercase, but now it's in a nice Title Case, where the first
        letter of each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using
        <code>text-transform: capitalize;</code> we can implement title cased
        content.

      <h3>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h3>
      <h4><code>px</code> (pixels)</h4>
      <p>
        Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default the
        browser sets the root font size to 16px, but you can change the font
        size in the body element or any other HTML element by setting font-size
        to any number of px.
      </p>
      <h4><code>em</code></h4>
      <p>
        em units size font relative to the parent element. For example, if the
        body element is 16px, and a nested div element's font size is set to
        1.5em, the browser will multiply 16px x 1.5, resulting in 24px font in
        the div.
      </p>
      <h4><code>rem</code>(root em)</h4>
      <p>
        Root em units are similar to em, but they are relative to the root font
        size instead of the parent element of whatever is being styled. For
        example, if the root font size (the font size of the body element) is
        set to 16px, and we have a p element nested many layers down with a
        font-size set to 2rem, that paragraph will have 32px font. If the body
        font size ever changes, this paragraph will also change accordingly.
      </p>
      <h4>Which one do I use?</h4>
      <p>
        Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using em or rem over
        px, since they make responsive typography that scales up and down across
        different device widths much easier. Using px for your font sizes is not
        as dynamic, and you may find that writing media queries to update all
        the various element font sizes in pixels at different screen widths is
        not the most scalable approach to typography
      </p>
      <p>
        Between em and rem, rem has a nice advantage of all elements being
        relative to one single root font value, where nested elements with
        parent/child font size dependencies can still be hard to manage with em
        units. When writing responsive styles, rem allows you to simply update
        the root font size at different screen sizes and all elements using rem
        units will adjust themselves accordingly creating a super easy-to-manage
        typography size system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but
        it's always important to understand the drawbacks of writing styles that
        may not be responsive or dynamic.
